/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Supermoda Raffles.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a role-based access control model with dedicated collections for data and admin roles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/coupons/{couponId}`: Stores individual raffle coupon data.
 * - `/roles_admin/{adminUserId}`: Presence of a document grants admin privileges to the corresponding user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access to coupons is allowed.
 * - Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin` collection.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping but authorization checks are strictly enforced.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Admin status is denormalized into the `/roles_admin/{adminUserId}` collection. This avoids complex queries to determine admin privileges.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Coupons and admin user roles are stored in separate collections for improved security and scalability.
